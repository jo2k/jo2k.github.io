# Theming

I'm using the Jekyll Hacker theme for the site.

I don't like the use of the double greater than (`>>`) for lists - so I'll need to find out how to edit that.

Well - it's either that or using html files with Bootstrap. I think that markdown is easier, just need to customize this theme a little bit more to fit my needs.
